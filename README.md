## **Overview**
In today's world, women continue to face various forms of harassment, violence, and discrimination in both public and private spaces. The pervasive nature of these challenges highlights the urgent need for effective solutions to ensure the safety and security of women.

### **Problem Statement**

- **Physical violence**: Women are more likely to experience physical assault, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking than men.

- **Harassment**: Women are frequently subjected to verbal harassment, catcalling, unwanted touching, and online harassment, creating a climate of fear and insecurity.
  
- **Discrimination**: Systemic biases and inequalities can contribute to a lack of access to resources and support, further putting women at a disadvantage.

- **Limited options**: In many situations, women may lack reliable ways to access help quickly and discreetly, especially in public spaces or unfamiliar environments.

#### Post-incident problems:

- **Fear of retaliation**: Reporting incidents can sometimes lead to further threats or harassment.
  
- **Justice system inefficiencies**: Navigating legal systems and seeking justice can be daunting and frustrating.
